In Objective-C, a common yet subtle issue arises when dealing with `NSDateFormatter`.  Specifically, if you don't set the `locale` property explicitly, the date formatter will use the device's current locale. This can lead to inconsistencies and unexpected behavior if the app is used in different regions or if the device's locale changes.  For instance, date parsing might fail or produce incorrect results if the input date string format doesn't match the current locale's conventions.  Another issue is related to thread safety. `NSDateFormatter` is not thread-safe, meaning that if multiple threads access and modify the same `NSDateFormatter` instance concurrently, it can lead to data corruption or crashes.
